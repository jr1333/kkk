Update changelog
A lot of bug fixes to previous release

- Remove the use of robolectric for unit testing. Now android ships
  native unit testing support.

- Refactor entities to use getters and setters so they can be mocked.

- Add test for post message.

- Add test for single and multiple messages synchronization.

- Fix #362 - Use the device's phone number for the `sent_to`
  field instead of the `from` number.

- Fix #369 - Set imported messages from the phone's inbox `type`
  to `pending` and `status` to failure. This prevents the app
  from crashing when an attempt is made to fetch messages from the app's
  inbox.

- Swipe to manually sync individual messages in the pending list is
  is broken because there was no method call to cause the sync.
  Made a call to `publishItem(int position)` when a swipe occurs.

- Add test for IP based Integration.

- When Test Ingeration button is hit, the app makes a request using
  configured request method to the server. The test request doesn't
  send the `message` and `from` variables to the server. This sometimes
  causes validation error when the server is strict about those two
  parameters. This sometimes leads to testing of the integration to
  report invalid endpoint has been entered. To fix this, added a
  hardcoded message and from values so those are sent along with the
  secret values. This actually makes the test report that the
  configured integration can actually receive messages from the app.

- Upgrade android gradle plugin

color.

fragment.

Only update alert phone number changes the logs when a change happens

Launching the settings screen always log an entry for the alert phone

the entry

changed example urls to https.
added example URL in howto on basic auth.
removed stacktrace comment.
added basic auth test, bit more MainHTTPClient refactor.

client.getRequest() will throw an exeption on encoding errors.

Removed `addHeader` using `setHeader` and HashMap.
removed `getFromWebService` method from MainHttpClient

added helper method `execute` that takes String method arg.
continued MessageSyncHttpClient refactor.

Changed constructor signature for MessageSyncHttpClient, added message
and phone. Updated tests.

Fixed call to `getFromWebService` in ProcessMessage, use MainHttpClient
instead.

Fixed bug in base class for request in MainHttpClient, use
HttpRequestBase instead of HttpUriRequest.

Removed executeGet/Post/Put, use setEntity, setMethod and executeRequest
separately.

Added `getRequest` to MainHttpClient for easier testing and backwards
compatibility.

Renamed `executeRequest` to `execute` to cover base class call.

Fixed bug in `String.format` calls.
refactored ProcessMessage and MessageSyncHtptClient classes.

Using new helpers in MainHttpClient.

added set/getClientError even though it's not being used yet, should
probably hook into wherever `getServerError` is called.
added getParams, setEntity to MainHttpClient class.

also fixed bug with setting entity correctly.
indentation/style tweaks.
adds basic auth support and refactored MainHttpClient class.

fixes ushahidi#17

This handled adding user-agent and basic auth headers to all requests.
Allows easily adding query params or headers via `addParam`. and
`addHeader`.

Planning to reuse this class a bit more in some related callback
features. Also was planning to refactor MessageSyncHttpClient and use
the new methods to simplify a bit and show how to use the API.

I replaced the poorly named `getText` function with a `getResponse` and
`convertStreamToString` static method.

Also added `$` to URL_PATTERN in case you have that in your basic auth
password.
