Better asynchronous image loading for BookmarksFragment

Previous AsyncTask would throw a RejectedExecutionException if too many
AsyncTasks got spawned on the thread pool executor. The solution was to

necessary. Also switched to using weakreference for the view and set
timeouts on image loading so it can load faster.

Fixed bug in release builds where event bus events were not being fired
Initialize ui color variable
Fixed ColorMode on the desktop tab UI by caching the backing Bitmap rather than immutable BitmapDrawable

BitmapDrawable turns out is sort of immutable even when using mutate()
so what was happening was that when switching from a tab on the right to
a tab on the left, the foreground drawable was set as the background of
two views for a small instant as the RecyclerView binds views from left
to right and the setColorFilter on the left foreground tab was not
working at all. When you switched from a left to right tab, it worked
fine because the left tab background was changed before the right and
the foreground drawable was only used by one view in that case. The
solution was to not reuse the drawable but instead reuse the backing
bitmap and create a new drawable whenever a tab moved to the foreground.

Rather than try to correct the issue of the Comparator crashing in

prevents the BookmarkManager from throwing an NPE when sorting the items
by title.

Since the maximum amount of displayed suggestions is set at 5, it makes
sense to limit the query to a maximum of 5. This speeds up the query
significantly which makes queries more responsive.

Not allow to zoom in the internal pages.

This commit prevents an user from zooming in the Home Page, Bookmarks
Page and History Page.
On some devices, for examlpe, some tablets with low dpi, tapping the
search bar in the Home Page would zoom the browser in about 25% and then
open the keyboard. That looks weird.
Also, the Lightning Browser does not allow zooming in the Settings menu
and the Tabs/Bookmarks sidebars. Allowing the user to zoom in one place
of the UI and not in the other is inconsitent.
